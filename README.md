  > My user eXperience with fixing my parent's broken laptop:
Last Sunday morning, my Dad woke me up saying he needed some technical support with his laptop that suddenly stopped working. The computer reported that it had somehow lost it's operating system, meaning it would no longer boot to the Windows login page. My parents were confused by this screen, saying that hadn't done anything that would have caused this, and were requesting my help. My current goal in this endeavor now was to get this laptop back to a working state. I started off by assessing the current state of the laptop, it presented a screen saying there was no operating system present and that it needed one to proceed. Thankfully, I've been in situations like this before and knew how to get a working version of Windows 10 on this laptop by using a USB bootdrive. A USB bootdrive is a simple USB thumbdrive that has a operating system on it as well as a way for that operating system to be installed on whatever computer it is plugged into. This **memorable** process only took a few minutes, being that I've done it before and it is fairly simple, is definately a strength that the Windows operating system has. Now, with my USB bootdrive in hand, I plugged it into the laptop, entered the BIOS screen of the laptop (which stands for **B**asic **I**nput/**O**utput **S**ystem), and changed the boot order to select the USB drive first. Once the bootup begins, the reinstalliation process becomes very **error tolerant** as it gives a step by step on what to do and what options are usually the best. After a few minutes and the reinstallation complete, the laptop regained it working status and my parents were thankful. I was even able to save all the original files on the computer as well!
